        Hobbies
    </h1>
        <h2><ul>
           <li>Going to the gym</ul></li> 
        </h2>
            <p>I started going to the gym back in 2022 with my best friend, Gina. Ever since I started it has become a hobby of mine. To want to be stronger and it helps a lot mentally to consistently go. It is also a way to spend more time with her and also become our thing<i>"to go to the gym"</i>  so that makes it even more special.</p>
        <h2><ul>
            <li>Going to watch films at the cinema</li></ul></h2>
            <p>Ever since I have known I have always loved being an consumer for film and series. Although Netflix does it's job, the experience of going and waiting in line for popcorn,scanning the tickets,watching the movie and even the experience after coming out of the cinema can never be matched.</p>

        Goals 
    </h1>
        <h2><ul>
            <li>To be able to code and design </li></ul></h2>
            <p>Choosing CAT in high school took my interest to new heights.Of course it wasn;'t advanced as this course , which I'm greatful for to have joined, but put me into perspective about my future career path. By the end of the 6 months I would want to have a fully designed website that I am proud with and feel secure to further pursue code.</p>
        <h2><ul><li>To learn more about myself and make new friends</li></ul></h2>
            <p>Since <b>Life Choices</b> is definitely more about code and includes life lessons. I would want to make the most out of it and meet new people who I can learn from and make lomg-lasting memories with. As well as learning more about myself and benefiting from it. </p>
